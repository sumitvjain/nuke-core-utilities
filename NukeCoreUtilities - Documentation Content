Overview
Introduction
"Building professional Nuke tools is hard. Every developer faces the same problems: 
repetitive boilerplate code, inconsistent error handling, and hours spent debugging. 
Nuke Core Utilities solves this. 
It's a complete Python package with eight specialized modules that work together seamlessly. 
Whether you're automating simple tasks or building complex pipeline tools,
this package gives you production-ready solutions immediately."


The Core Module - Foundation
"The Core module is your foundation. It automatically detects everything: your system, 
Nuke version, available memory, and project context. It provides professional logging integrated with 
Nuke's Script Editor - colored output, file rotation, and structured JSON logs. All your constants and 
configurations are centralized here. Change a color scheme once, and all your tools update automatically. 
No more rewriting the same environment checks."


Data & Graph Modules - Performance & Intelligence
"The Data module handles caching intelligently. Expensive operations like graph analysis are cached automatically, 
making your tools significantly faster. It manages metadata and file operations with backups and validation."

"The Graph module understands node connections. It can analyze complex graphs, find paths between nodes, 
detect circular dependencies, and automatically organize messy scripts with hierarchical, radial, 
or grid layouts. No more manual node dragging."


Nodes Module - Smart Operations
"The Nodes module transforms how you work with nodes. Create nodes with templates, grids, or 
groups in one intelligent call - not multiple steps. Delete nodes safely with connection cleanup and 
automatic backups. Modify nodes with professional alignment, distribution, and automatic coloring by node type. 
Query nodes with sophisticated search - by class, knob values, position, or complex patterns."


Project & Render Modules - Production Ready
"The Project module brings production awareness. It manages show/shot/task context automatically, 
resolves paths using templates, and handles version control. Set up complete shot structures with one command."

"The Render module provides professional render management. Queue multiple renders with priorities, 
monitor progress, validate write nodes, and use output templates for consistent results. 
Perfect for batch processing and render farm integration."


Utilities & Integration
"The Utilities module includes specialized tools: validation frameworks to catch issues early, 
knob management for custom nodes, callback systems for event-driven programming, 
and isolation tools for focusing on complex scripts."

"What makes this powerful is integration. All modules work together. Environment detection informs node operations. 
Caching speeds up graph analysis. Project context guides path resolution. 
You're not using isolated tools - you're building on a complete, cohesive system."


Benefits & Getting Started
"With Nuke Core Utilities, you save development time, ensure consistency across tools, 
get better debugging with structured logs, and build professional tools from day one. 
Installation is simple - pip install into Nuke's Python. Documentation and examples are included. 
Start building better Nuke tools today, with the foundation already done for you."
